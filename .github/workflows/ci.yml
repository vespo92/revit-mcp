  # TODO: Re-enable after fixing:
  # - Jest configuration (ES modules)
  # - ESLint TypeScript resolver
  # - Add basic test files
  
  # lint:
  #   # Disabled: ESLint configuration needs fixing
  #   # Error: "typescript with invalid interface loaded as resolver"
  
  # test:
  #   # Disabled: Jest configuration incompatible with ES modules
  #   # Error: "module is not defined in ES module scope"
  #   # Also: No test files exist after cleanup
